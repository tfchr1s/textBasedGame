This is where the guards spend their day locked away, watching us shuttle around the building. There's a guard in here now, but they are asleep, let's keep it that way. I wish we had access to the computers here... I wonder what’s locked away in all these drawers... I can go east from here.

The garden… not really into this kinda stuff, but it would make hiding things much easier. Who knew prisoners had a knack for gardening. Most of the time, the media portrays them as rabid animals. I can go South or East from here.
